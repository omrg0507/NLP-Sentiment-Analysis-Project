# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
These were the initial goals of the project:

1) Develop a sentiment analysis model with high accuracy in classifying customer sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) based on product reviews and comments on the e-commerce website.

2) Extract specific product-related sentiments to guide product development and enhancement efforts based on customer feedback and preferences.

3) Create intuitive visualizations (e.g. charts) to present sentiment analysis results for easy interpretation by stakeholders such as product managers, marketers, and customer support teams.
