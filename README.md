# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Develop a sentiment analysis model with
high accuracy in classifying customer
sentiments (positive, negative, neutral)
based on product reviews and comments
on the e-commerce website.
● Extract specific product-related
sentiments to guide product development
and enhancement efforts based on
customer feedback and preferences.
● Create intuitive visualizations (e.g. charts)
to present sentiment analysis results for
easy interpretation by stakeholders such
as product managers, marketers, and
customer support teams.
